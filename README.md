flash-fcav
==========

Flash Implementation of the Forest Threat Assessment Viewer.  This project was imported
from svn+ssh://svn.nemac.org/usr/local/svn-repos/EWS_GIS/trunk on Aug 20, 2012.  Prior
versions of the project are in that subversion repository.

Note: the `bin-deploy` directory contains (relatively static) files that should be copied to the deployment
destination along with the contents of bin-release.  So, a deployed copy consists of everything from
a built `bin-release` directory together with everything from the `bin-deploy` directory.

Update Mon Oct  6 08:29:58 2014
-------------------------------

This project is now completely static, and the deployed files are all
in the `html` directory. The `bin-release` and `bin-deploy` dirs, and
the `fcav` script, are from a no-longer-used build/deploy process.
