==========

Flash Implementation of the Forest Threat Assessment Viewer.  This project was imported
from svn+ssh://svn.nemac.org/usr/local/svn-repos/EWS_GIS/trunk on Aug 20, 2012.  Prior
versions of the project are in that subversion repository.

Note: the bin-deploy directory contains (relatively static) files that should be copied to the deployment
destination along with the contents of bin-release.  So, a deployed copy consists of everything from
a built bin-release directory together with everything from the bin-deploy directory.
